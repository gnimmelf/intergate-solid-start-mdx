Flemming Hansen, a Javascript and Linux nerd, birthed in the stone ages of the internet. [Contact me](mailto:hi@flemmingh.io) for anything web-related.

I work within enterprise as a consultant and programmer, mainly TS / React and build pipe-lines, and outside enterprise with anything that is Javascript.

<ExpandableDetails summary='Need a web-site?' centerContent={true}>
I can help you navigate the tech-jungle to find what is best for you. I can tell you what you need, what you don't need, and why. I can tell you that I won't create it for you because somebody else will do it cheaper, even better.

Or I can make you the equivalent of a nuclear factory, with all the whistles and bells.

<ExpandableDetails summary='Need some extra manpower?' centerContent={true}>
Do you have a legacy site in need of update? Maybe with a huge technical debt, no documentation, and already have had a dosen people work at it during it's life-time?

I can probably help with that.

<ExpandableDetails summary='Need some extra functionality on an existing website?' centerContent={true}>
I specialise in interoperability and integration of web-technologies. Micro-frontends, sites and apps within sites, connecting things together.

<ExpandableDetails summary='Just want to talk about the landscape?' centerContent={true}>
Ideas of how stuff can be done, emerging trends, available standards, what to look for when setting up a small team?

Pay me for my time, I have decades of experience with web-sites and web-development, and I like talking about web-technologies and how to best utilize it for a set goal.
