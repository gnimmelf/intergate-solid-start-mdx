Led the refactoring of a complex legacy React application that suffered from significant technical debt. Initially, React was used solely as a view layer, leading to architectural limitations and maintenance challenges. Rewrote the app's architecture to transform it into a fully-fledged Single Page Application (SPA) by introducing state management, routing, and internationalization (i18n), bringing the codebase in line with modern best practices. Integrated robust state management to centralize and streamline the handling of data, improving app scalability and performance. Implemented routing to enable seamless navigation across various components, ensuring a smooth user experience. Added support for internationalization (i18n), allowing the application to cater to users from different regions and languages. Set up telemetry and performance monitoring using Microsoft Application Insights SDK for JavaScript, providing valuable insights into user behavior, system performance, and error tracking.

Developed a Node.js-based CLI tool for transferring large volumes of photo images over the internet to recipient systems’ APIs. The tool was designed to handle significant data loads while maintaining high performance and reliability. Utilized RxJS for streamlining and optimizing the flow of image transfers, leveraging reactive programming to manage asynchronous operations effectively. Tuned the tool to minimize memory usage and ensure smooth operation despite hardware constraints, enabling the tool to handle large image batches with limited resources. Extracted and processed EXIF metadata from photos accumulated over 10 years, contributed by different photographers and image programs, normalizing and consolidating the data for consistent and accurate use. Ensured that the tool was robust enough to handle inconsistencies in image formats and metadata, providing a reliable and automated solution for managing large-scale image transfers.
