Led the cleanup and refactoring of a legacy JavaScript frontend system for Fjellinjen AS, which managed toll road payments for their customers. The original JavaScript codebase was a single 3,000-line file, making it difficult to maintain and extend. This project took place before modern bundlers and module systems became widely available, requiring the development of a custom module system to organize the code into manageable, reusable components. The refactoring significantly improved code readability, maintainability, and performance, ensuring the system could support future updates and new features more efficiently.
