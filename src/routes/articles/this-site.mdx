# Overview

This site is a hobby project based on [solid-start](https://start.solidjs.com/), with inspiration from [SolidBase](https://solidbase.dev/).

- All content is [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

- [Yaml Frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) is used for all pages

- A custom plugin is used to add frontmatter data as exports for each mdx-file

- [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) is used for styling in conjunction with [digdir/designsystemet](https://designsystemet.no)

- Various other MDX-plugins are used to further format the mdx-content

# MDX

MDX in static websites is a blessing, and it is finally mature enough, even for other frameworks than react.

That does not mean it is simple. It is actually quite complex, and really an entire domain of its own.

For this site I got it working by a bit of trial and error. Fortunately for a static site like this,
if it compiles and renders, then that is good enough.

I have a set of 3. party plugins doing standard frontmatter stuff, and then a custom `mdast` transformer
adding the frontmatter data as module exports.

```js
import {
  frontmatterFromMarkdown,
  frontmatterToMarkdown
} from 'mdast-util-frontmatter'
import { parse as parseYaml } from 'yaml'
import { define } from 'unist-util-mdx-define'
import { valueToEstree } from 'estree-util-value-to-estree'
import { frontmatter } from 'micromark-extension-frontmatter'

/**
* Initializes frontmatter parsing extensions for MDX.
 * @param {*} extentions
 */
function initializePlugin(pluginInstance, format = 'yaml') {
  const data = pluginInstance.data();

  data.micromarkExtensions = data.micromarkExtensions || [];
  data.fromMarkdownExtensions = data.fromMarkdownExtensions || [];
  data.toMarkdownExtensions = data.toMarkdownExtensions || [];

  data.micromarkExtensions.push(frontmatter(format));
  data.fromMarkdownExtensions.push(frontmatterFromMarkdown(format));
  data.toMarkdownExtensions.push(frontmatterToMarkdown(format));
}

export default function parseFrontmatter(options = {}) {
  const self = this
  options = Object.assign({
    dataKey: 'frontmatter',
    format: 'yaml',
    parser: parseYaml
  }, options)

  initializePlugin(self, options.format)

  return function transformer(mdast, vfile) {
    const node = mdast.children.find((child) => options.format === child.type)
    if (node) {
      const data = options.parser(node.value)
      if (data) {
        // Add data to vfile
        vfile.data = data
          // Add data as an export to the mdast
        define(mdast, vfile, { [options.dataKey]: valueToEstree(data, { preserveReferences: true }) })
      }
    }

  };
};
```

# Styling

---

<center>⚠ Disclaimer! I'm a Panda CSS fan.</center>

---

For styling I've used [Panda CSS](panda-css.com).

> CSS-in-JS with build time generated styles, RSC compatible, multi-variant support,
and best-in-class developer experience.

CSS is in my opinion the *final piece* missing from the frontend DX.
Css by itself is notoriously difficult to keep lean and clean. Modularisation
has been an issue since forever, and `css-in-js` solutions are a difficult thing
to implement due to runtime vs compiletime.

The `atomic` or `utility` css trend is, again in my opinion, an stepping-stone solution
for all of these issues. By overburdening the non-semantic atomic classes into
the markup, the markup both becomes tightly coupled the styling system, and cluttered.

Browser standards aim for semantic clarity for a reason. SPA authors should do the same ***if***
we want a long lived product. -If a long lived product is not the goal, then no problem.

Here is an exellent writup on the challenges of css and its paradigms on Smashing Magazine:

- [CSS Cascade Layers - Specificity Control](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/06/css-cascade-layers-bem-utility-classes-specificity-control/)

Panda CSS takes the atomic css trend one step further and, conceptually speaking,
making atomic classes the foundation for semantic classes.
This is achievable with most atomic libraries like Tailwind by using the `@apply` directive,
but in Panda the idiomatic way is to *not* use atomic css. Big difference.

Still, the Panda `css-in-js` code needs to live somewhere, and there are limitations on where we
can put it due to Panda's way of analysing code. But the separation from the markup / jsx is there, and
the style-code *is* pure Js/Ts, so it has enough separation to make the domain code much (c)leaner and less locked in.

Still, for Panda, there is a learning curve and a scope that needs to be weighted.

## Designsystemet.no

With Panda CSS as the "Styling Engine", I was looking to explore how to make a styling system.
Using `LHC` instead of hex-colors is a given. The end result may be in hex, but all the
computations are better done in the most easily understandable color system, and that is `LHC` and variants.

I always fear this because I am not a designer. Good design is difficult, and colors are the first hurdle.

I have long imagined a system where I set one base color, and the rest is computed. I had a go at this
and the result was ok. There are always two-three big, interdependent challenges when making a system like this:

1. Deciding on the semantic tokens

2. Tweaking the colors to match and contrast one-another

3. Make 1) and 2) work with as few tokens as possible

This can only be solved with tons of experience or tons of tweaking. Both take time.

While doing this I can across [Digdir/Designsytemet](https://designsystemet.no)
which is an effort to make a common designsystem for Norwegian government departments.
And of course they allready had solved the fine-tuning adequatly.

So I kept my ramps and calculations for where I needed those, and just imported the color-schema generators from Designsystemet.

The result from this is wrapped to Panda token specs, and I only needed to swap out usage of the old base tokens for
the ones from Designsystemet, and voila, automatic color schemes - tuned by professionals - based on one single base color.
-And due to Panda's tokens, like `multi-theme Tokens`, it just works in a multitude of ways.

# Build and Deploy

This site is deployed with `deno deploy`.

To minimize code, Panda CSS is built with hashing, which means that all atomic css is obfuscated into as few css classes as possible.

The production ready artifacts from `vinxi build` is then uploaded to Deno Deploy on free tier via Deno's `deployctl`.

I went with Deno Deploy just because it's simple and worked.
