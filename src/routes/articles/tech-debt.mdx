# Overview

Technical Debt (TD) mainly falls into two borad categories:

- **Architectural Debt**

- **Code Debt**

However, we need one more crucial distinction: Technical Debt can be **Tactical**.

## Tactical Debt

**Tactical Debt** is intentional, planned with management awareness, and includes:

- Infrastructure costs, tracked as regular expenses.

- Deliberate coding choices, like hardcoding or bypassing architecture for efficiency.

**Tactical Debt** is *visible* and *tracked*. If untracked, it becomes Technical Debt.

# Simplified Definitions

- **Architectural Debt**: System components too costly to change now.
- **Technical Debt**: Undesirable elements in the system, whether known or unknown.

These definitions highlight that assessing debt requires deep system insight, often beyond management's immediate understanding.

## Cost and Time

Technical Debt ties directly to cost, as effort over time. Tight deadlines can make broader changes impractical, requiring a phased plan to address them.

# Identifying Code Debt

The challenge with Technical Debt is its discovery. Issues often go unnoticed because processes to identify problematic code are lacking, and things tend to get buried deep.

## Rule #1: Use TODO! Comments

TODO! comments are valuable. Developers review many files during tasks, and TODO! notes highlight issues across contexts. Example:

```ts
// TODO! Simplify this logic. See #23456.
```

These comments persist in the codebase, ensuring immediate visibility, unlike task systems which are always at least one click away.

## Rule #2: Standardize TODO!

Use only "TODO!" (all caps, with exclamation). Avoid variations like "Fixme!" or "To do".

> The point is consistency.

## Rule #3: Convert TODOs to Tasks Regularly

Enterprise codebases are complex, and top-down approaches miss subtle issues. Regularly review TODOs and convert them into tasks. A tech lead or senior developer should:

- Assess TODOs in the codebase.

- Create well-described task items in the backlog.

- Update TODOs with task IDs, e.g.:

```ts
// TODO#23456! Simplify TS types for better reuse.
```

Examples of effective TODOs:

```ts
// TODO! Rewrite using new framework.
// TODO! Unclear logic, needs clarification.
// TODO! Move to /utils/helpers.
// TODO! Refactor into smaller components.
// TODO! Update for API change.
// TODO! Clean up TypeScript types.
```

## Rule #4: Centralize TODOs

Create a "Tech Debt Bucket" in the task management system - one per repository - to collect all TODOs.

## Rule #5: Manage the Tech Debt Bucket

The Tech Debt Bucket is a developer-driven space, free from strict Scrum rules. Developers should:
- Regularly groom TODOs into actionable Tech Debt Items.
- Ensure items are clear enough for management to understand and prioritize.

This process fosters collaboration and ensures Technical Debt is addressed systematically.
