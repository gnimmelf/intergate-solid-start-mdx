## Amature interests

In my spare time I am mix of an otaku- and DIY-nerd.

I am an ardent amature console gamer, I love good singler-player experiences, RPGs, soulslikes and metroidvanias, and I love a cerebral animes like Parasyte, Gleipnir and Grimgar. And of course the good sci-fi's like Akira, Appleseed and Ghost In The Shell / S.A.C.

DIY-wise, I build and fix stuff in and around the house. I am an aspiring metall-wroker with some cheap welding gear that I love very much, and I hope to one day to have a scrapyard and a side-business called MacGyverish, where I also grow chilli, tobacco and edible fungi.

I love a good book on philosophy, from Any Rand to Ludwig von Mises and to Buddhist treaties like Cascading Waterfall of Nectar.

Physically, I do a bit Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, yoga and weights, and during summers I do part-time work in forestry.
